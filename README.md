# LoLWorldsVisualization

This visualization is currently live using an s3 bucket at: https://lol-data-host.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homepage.html. Go check it out!

This was a small side project I did over the course of about 1-2 weeks to learn D3.js.
Using a LoL World Championship champion pick dataset, I visualized which champions were most desireable/strong at any given year. 
There is a built in tutorial on how to understand in play with the datset, so you may mess around however you like. 
Development on this project has stopped as I feel I have gotten a good enough understanding of D3.js, though I may spruce up the visuals a bit more in the future.

Dataset used was made by Vincent Barletta and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vincentbarletta/league-of-legends-worlds-champion-pb-dataset
